        <p>The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris)[4] is a domesticated descendant of the wolf, characterized by an upturning tail. The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,[5][6] and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.[7] The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[8][7] by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[6] before the development of agriculture.[1] Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely adapted to human behavior,[9] leading to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[11]</p>
